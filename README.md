# Sublime Text 3 plugin - Cypher

A plugin for working with [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org)'s [Cypher](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/cypher-query-lang.html) query language in [SublimeText3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3).

#Installation
* Download the zip file.
* Change the file extension from zip to sublime-package
* Copy the file to your `.../AppData/Roaming/Sublime Text 3/Installed Packages` directory

# Usage

* Type a Cypher query into your editor
* Run it by selecting the query and hitting (cmd+shift+r on OSX, ctrl+shift+r on Windows)
* The results or error will be shown in the console, which can be opened by (ctrl+`)
* If no text is selected, all the text in the file is run as a single query

# Future Plans
* Merge with the original
* Get package on package control
